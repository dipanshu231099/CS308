# VectorLib

Library dedicated for operations pertaining to R^4 real vectors.

## Compiling the library
- run ```make all``` to create the required executable ```vectorMain```.
- run ```./vectorMain``` to run the main driver code.

## Coding Style

- All the variables must use camelCase. (see more here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)
- The functions must not have any blank lines in between.
- There must be a gap of line between any two functions. An example is given below:

```cpp
    /* commenting about function 1 */
    function1(){
        asdf
        asdf
        asdf
    }

    /* commenting about function 2 */
    function2(){
        ...
    }
```

- Any new feature must be associated with a new branch and submitted by raising a pull request first.
